 - Media should implement the Comparable interface.
 - Just like the compare(o1, o2) in the Comparator class, o1 being "this" while o2 is the paramenter.
 - We can achieve that by creating a static field in the class Media which tells the compareTo() method to compare by cost or title.
 - You can override the compareTo() method in DVD class if you're using the Comparable approach.
If you're using the Comparator approach, you can use instanceof to test if the compared items are both DVD and compare those differently.
